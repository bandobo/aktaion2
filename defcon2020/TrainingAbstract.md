Aktaion V2 is a python3 project for detecting exploits (and more generally attack behaviors). The project is meant to be a learning/teaching

# Presentation Information

### Title: Aktaion V2 Training - Hands on with open source ML for Exploit Detection

This 2-hour training session will help the attendees to increase their understanding of how artificial intelligence can be used (with limitations) to build behavior based detections.

The lab will cover - the initial compromise of a client through spear phishing and exploiting a client side vulnerability - 
escalating the privileges on the compromised client - using the compromised client for pivoting, to attack other machines on the inside - 
using social engineering to get domain admin credentials - using domain admin credentials to grab hashes from a domain controller - 
using hashes in pass-the hash attacks and creating Golden Tickets.

The expected audience is network and security engineers and architects, 
who want to understand and get hands-on experience with the attackers mindset, methods and tools, in order to build better defenses. 
This lab will not discuss defensive techniques.

Students are require to use their own laptop or VM where they can install Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client for access to the lab.

### Required Materials:

A computer running Python 3.7 (virutalenv) along with the dependencies listed in the project requirements file
