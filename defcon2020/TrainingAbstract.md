### Title: Aktaion V2 Training - Hands on with open source ML for Exploit Detection

This 2-hour training session will help the attendees to increase their understanding of how artificial 
intelligence can be used (with limitations) to build behavior based detections.  We will use the open source project
[Aktaion](https://github.com/jzadeh/aktaion2) to discuss the internals of how this detection is built using standard python libraries for packet analysis and 
machine learning. 

Aktaion is a machine learning open source & active defense (orchestration) prototype. 
The tool focuses on the detection of ransomware based on machine learning techniques, 
independent of static-based signatures. The tool has been mentioned and featured in may respected community 
publications and research, and in years past presented at a variety of Blackhat Arsenal events. 
AKTAION v2 is the second iteration or port of the project from the original Java into Python3.

The lab will cover: 
1.  Building an end to end intrusion detection workflow for detecting exploit behavior
2.  Analysis of exploit attack data for meaningful encoding of statistics and behaviors to build detections with
3.  Examples of orchestration workflow tying in an upstream action into a detection event
4.  The Do's and Dont's of using Machine Learning (and complex software paradigms) for cybersecurity use cases

escalating the privileges on the compromised client - using the compromised client for pivoting, to attack other machines on the inside - 
using social engineering to get domain admin credentials - using domain admin credentials to grab hashes from a domain controller - 
using hashes in pass-the hash attacks and creating Golden Tickets.

The expected audience is network and security engineers and architects, or anyone with an interest in hacking and building 
tools that use behavior for defensive use cases. 

Students are required to use their own laptop and latest versions of python/pip tested and working.
